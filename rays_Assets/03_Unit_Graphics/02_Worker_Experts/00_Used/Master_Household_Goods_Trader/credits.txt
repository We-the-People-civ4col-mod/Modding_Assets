Mod: TAC-Tortuga:

Unit "Kartenzeichner":

- All of the unitmodel is from a Sid Meier's Pirates Model.
- The animations are from Civilization Colonization - the "Indentured_Servant"-Model.
- Both have been improved and modified by "Schmiddie" from the TAC-Team with Blender, Nifskope and Gimp to create a new unit "Kartenzeichner" for TAC-Tortuga.
