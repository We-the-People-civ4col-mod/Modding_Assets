		<English>[H1]Thanadelthur[\H1][NEWLINE][BOLD]Leader of the Chipewyan[\BOLD][NEWLINE][BOLD]Lived: [\BOLD]c.1697-1717[NEWLINE][PARAGRAPH:2][BOLD]Background:[\BOLD][NEWLINE][TAB]Thanadelthur, whose name means "Marten Shake" or "Marten Jumping", was born circa 1697. She was captured by the Cree sometime in 1713, when conflict between the two tribes had been exacerbated by the latter's trade with the Hudson Bay Company. Newly-equipped with firearms, the Cree increasingly gained the upper hand. [PARAGRAPH:1] Thanadelthur managed to escape with one of her friends but cold and hunger prevented them from reaching their home territory and brought the other young woman's death. Thanadelthur found her way to Fort York on November 24, 1714, thanks to employees of the Hudson's Bay Company, whom she met on the way. Her time in captivity had convinced her of the advantages English trade could bring her people. She told a representative about their rich fur resources, emphasizing that only fear of the Cree kept them from trade. Her tales of a vast body of tidal water that hardly froze some years, copper, and a mysterious "yellow mettle" in her country also caught his imagination. The representative realized that her enthusiasm and linguistic skills made her the ideal envoy. He immediately organized an expedition and assigned William Stuart, a Company employee, to lead it beyond Cree territory. [PARAGRAPH:1]On June Koyukon, 1715, Stuart, Thanadelthur and 150 Cree left Fort York with the various intentions of re-establishing peace between the Cree and the Chipewyan, bringing back some northern Native people to Fort York, announcing the construction of a fort at Churchill River, and looking for minerals. At Governor Knight's express request, Stuart was, above all, to protect the "slave woman". After having painfully crossed the tundra at the edge of the Boreal forest, they found five Chipewyans, killed by Cree, at the edge of a forest. Stuart and Thanadelthur knew that these murders would compromise the nations' reconciliation and the remaining expedition members were ready to turn back. Thanadelthur persuaded them to wait ten days while she, alone, went to get the Chipewyan. She came back at the last minute and managed to bring peace between the sides through lengthy negotiations. [PARAGRAPH:1]Her verve and determination fuelled the Hudson Bay Company's dreams of discoveries and the representatives were much more taken by the girl's stories than by Stuart's. Thanadelthur encouraged HBC to plan new expeditions but fell ill and died on February 7, 1717.</English>
